  <p>Welcome to Concerts @ The Creek!  We provide listings to
     all events happening @ The Creek for most of the Summer 2020.
     Take a look around if you have a minute and see all the great
     bands that will be performing right in your very own backyard!
  </p>
  <p>Make sure to bring the entire family.  At each event, there will be plenty of 
    activities, even for the little ones.   Face painting, food stands, games and more!
  </p>
  <p>Safety of our patrons is of utmost importance to us here @ The Creek - you can count on it.  
     We have private security services patrolling the entire grounds before, during and after each and every event.  
     So, your safety is of no worry to you and your family, as you enjoy the day/evening with us!
  </p>
  <p>
     C'mon down and let's get this summer heated up even more!  We hope to see you soon...
  </p>
